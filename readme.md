This repo contains a full stack project called SynthRadar, which musicians can find and buy synthesizers, drumboxes and other stuff necessary to make music. This project is focused mainly in vintage instruments, because they are really expensive and sometimes hard to find. So, if you want something, with this webapp you could create an alert and receive an email when somebody sells itself.

SynthRadar is made with PUG for rendering on back-end with the idea to get a better SEO as much as possible.

Technologies used on front: 
-CSS3
-Bootstrap 
-Jquery
-JavaScript

Back-End:
-Express
-Pug
-Node JS
-Mongo DB
-Mongoose
